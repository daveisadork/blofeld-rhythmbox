This plugin will let you have a Blofeld server as a source in Rhythmbox. Unless
you have a Blofeld server, or know someone who does and has given you access,
then this won't do anything for you. You can find out about Blofeld by visiting
http://github.com/daveisadork/Blofeld 

To use this plugin, you need to stick these files in a folder inside of the
Rhythmbox plugins folder. You might accomplish such a thing like this:

  cd ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/
  git clone git://github.com/daveisadork/blofeld-rhythmbox.git

Then you should have ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/blofeld-rhythmbox which
should have two files in it. You need to edit __init__.py and look for the
configuration section at the very top. Change the PATH_TO_BLOFELD, USERNAME
and PASSWORD variables to something that makes sense.

Now you can launch Rhythmbox and enable the plugin (hopefully) and you should
have Blofeld listed as a source. Now you can listen to music, yay! While you're
doing that, write a configuration UI and then send me a pull request.
